# This is a react project created as a code along with a udemy course called "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" we incorperated react compents to build out a simple search app that connects to a JSON placeholder api as well as interactive compenents with a very reactive website. Redux has been added as an exercise to make state immutable as well as incorperate loggers into the console.
